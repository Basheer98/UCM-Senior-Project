# Getting Started

open the project up with a gradle compatible complier, such as intellj idea, <with the community edition>

alternatively, you can also use eclipse with the correct gradle plugins via the import feature, or you could run gradle command line if your using a different complier

I have set the project to java 17, at least have java JDK 17 on your system or later to run the project.

you should be able to run the code either commandline with the standard gradle build command, or with build/run button in intellj idea.
